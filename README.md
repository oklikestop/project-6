# **Gel Electrophoresis**

 > Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate DNA fragments according to their size. [source](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/biotech-dna-technology/dna-sequencing-pcr-electrophoresis/a/gel-electrophoresis)

1. isolate DNA and preprocess it, then mix in dye  to help visualize the movement of the sample through the gel. [source](https://biologydictionary.net/gel-electrophoresis/)
1. TAE buffer provides a source of ions for setting up the *electric field* during electrophoresis.   [source](https://biologydictionary.net/gel-electrophoresis/)
1. The weight-to-volume concentration of agarose in TAE buffer is used to prepare the solution.   [source](https://biologydictionary.net/gel-electrophoresis/)

## **Fun Facts**

* if a 1% agarose gel is required, 1g of agarose is added to 100mL of TAE. The agarose percentage used is determined by how big or small the DNA is expected to be.   [source](https://biologydictionary.net/gel-electrophoresis/)

* If one is looking at separating a pool of smaller size DNA bands (<500bp), a higher percentage agarose gel (>1%) is prepared. The higher percentage of agarose creates a denser sieve to increase the separation of small DNA length differences.   [source](https://biologydictionary.net/gel-electrophoresis/)

* The agarose-TAE solution is heated to dissolve the agarose.  [source](https://biologydictionary.net/gel-electrophoresis/)
 
# **IN THE FUTURE**

In the future of *Gel* *Electrophoresis* there might be.

* better things used ti enable a glow under UV light. That will not possibly cause genetic abnormalities. 

* a replacement or better form of agarose.

* more efictive method of Electrophoresis
